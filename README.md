Blockchain Consensus Algorithm Mechanism Comparison.

Since there are no 50,000 feet view of blockchain consensus algorithms/mechanisms readily available anywhere, and with the world moving towards pluggable distributed consensus, this is the world's first attempt (that is, my attempt) to do this -- this Blockchain Consensus Algorithm Mechanism Comparison will help users decide which platform (Eth, Hyperledger, R3, etc) to adopt based on their consensus/privacy needs.
